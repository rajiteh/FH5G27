# G27 LED Bridge

Multi-game telemetry bridge that maps in-game RPM data to Logitech G27 Racing Wheel's RPM LED bar.

## Supported Games
- **DiRT Rally 2.0** - Original implementation
- **Forza Horizon 5** - New addition with full telemetry support

### LED Mapping

Active LED states are mapped linearly to RPM range `[(max - (max - idle) / 2)..max]`.

### Requirements

#### DiRT Rally 2.0 Setup
Requires DiRT Rally 2.0 telemetry option to be enabled.

Edit the file: `C:\Users\<UserName>\Documents\My Games\DiRT Rally 2.0\hardwaresettings\hardware_settings_config.xml`

Set the udp value to: `<udp enabled="true" extradata="3" ip="127.0.0.1" port="20777" delay="1" />`

#### Forza Horizon 5 Setup
Enable telemetry in game settings:
1. Go to **Settings > Gameplay & HUD**
2. Under **UDP RACE TELEMETRY**:
   - Set **Data Out** to **On**
   - Set **Data Out IP Address** to **127.0.0.1**
   - Set **Data Out IP Port** to **9999** (or your preferred port)
   - Set **Data Out Packet Format** to **Sled** (recommended for performance)

### Usage

**DiRT Rally 2.0** (default):
```bash
g27-led-bridge.exe
# or explicitly specify
g27-led-bridge.exe --game dirt-rally-2
```

**Forza Horizon 5**:
```bash
g27-led-bridge.exe --game forza-horizon-5
# or short form
g27-led-bridge.exe --game fh5
```

**Custom port**:
```bash
g27-led-bridge.exe --game fh5 --port 12345
```

**Test LED functionality** without game running:
```bash
# Single test cycle
g27-led-bridge.exe test

# Continuous test pattern (press Ctrl+C to stop)
g27-led-bridge.exe test --continuous
```

**Available game aliases**:
- DiRT Rally 2.0: `dirt-rally-2`, `dr2`, `dirt`
- Forza Horizon 5: `forza-horizon-5`, `fh5`, `forza`

### Troubleshooting

**G27 not found:**
- Ensure G27 is connected via USB
- Check Windows Device Manager for Logitech devices
- Try unplugging and reconnecting the wheel

**UDP Socket errors:**
- Port may be in use by another application
- Try a different port: `--port 20778`
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Ensure the game is actually sending telemetry data

**LEDs not responding:**
1. Test LED functionality: `g27-led-bridge test`
2. Verify game telemetry is enabled and configured correctly
3. Check that you're in an active race/driving session
4. Confirm correct port number matches game settings

**No telemetry data received:**
- Verify game telemetry settings (IP: 127.0.0.1, correct port)
- Ensure you're actively driving (not in menus)
- For Forza: Make sure "IsRaceOn" is true (in active race/session)

### Building from Source

**Prerequisites:**
- Rust 1.70+ (tested with Rust 1.90.0)
- Windows (for G27 HID support)

**Build commands:**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rajiteh/FH5G27.git
cd FH5G27

# Build release version
cargo build --release

# Executable will be at: target/release/g27-led-bridge.exe
```

### Compatibility

**Tested Successfully With:**
- âœ… **Logitech G27 Racing Wheel** - Full LED support
- âœ… **DiRT Rally 2.0** - Original implementation  
- âœ… **Forza Horizon 5** - Newly added with live testing
- âœ… **Windows 10/11** - Primary development platform

**LED Behavior:**  
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green LEDs** (1-2): Low to moderate RPM range
- ðŸŸ  **Orange LEDs** (3-4): Higher RPM approaching redline  
- ðŸ”´ **Red LED** (5): Maximum RPM / redline warning
